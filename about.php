							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that in India quantity of e-waste is much larger which is quite an issue, and it is most rapidly growing segment of the formal municipal waste stream in the world. E-waste or Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipments (WEEE) are loosely discarded, surplus, obsolete, broken, or mostly used devices.</p>

							<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People generally do not know how to discard these things, so it becomes waste. Due to this balance of nature is getting worse and worse by each day. So we are providing this web system for trading electrical or electronics equipments, so we can contribute some for nature.</p>
